# Written Number Recognition Model
 <p> <strong> My personal project using a dataset from Kaggle </strong> </p>

 <p> This program used the dataset to train a machine learning some machine learning models and determine which model performs best. </p>

 <p> This is the initial step of my future project in building a robust OCR machine. My goal is to build a website where user can simply upload a piece of writing on a paper, which will return a file including the translation of the image to a doc document, which users can change and reformat. </p>

 <p> If you also have an interest in this field, I would love to connect and work on it together! </p>
